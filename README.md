This project aims to create an SMB server compliant with the SMB3.0 specification from Microsoft. This server will be written in C++ and architected to be as efficient as possible. It will run on embedded devices and scale to 10's of 100's of enterprise servers. 

The libsmb3 library will be used to help build the server. The server will be built to run on 4 different types of microprocessor architectures initially. This is due to few resources and popularity of the architectures.


Supported Compilers: Clang 3.1

Supported OS types: BSD, Unix (Solaris/Mac OS X 10.7+), GNU/Linux
